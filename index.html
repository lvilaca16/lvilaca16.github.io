                        <h1>About me</h1>

                        <p>
                            üëã Hi, my name is Lu√≠s. I‚Äôm a research scholar at INESC TEC, specifically working within the Centre for Telecommunications and Multimedia (CTM), in the Multimedia Communications Technologies (MCT) research team.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            üìö I completed both my BSc and MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the School of Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            üñ•Ô∏è During my time as a research assistant at INESC TEC, I have been involved in various multimedia-related projects, exploring concepts and tools in Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML). My contributions are documented in several technical reports and conference papers (core A*, B). I have also organized workshops, co-supervised master's theses, mentored summer internships, and presented ongoing work for dissemination purposes at international project meetings. In addition, I have served as an assistant professor at ISEP and FEUP, teaching courses in computational systems, data communications, multimedia and information retrieval. For a brief period, I worked at the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo (Japan), focusing on multimodal machine learning, representation learning for audio-visual data, and cross-modal retrieval.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            üî¨ I am currently midway through my PhD, expecting to graduate by July 2027. My research focuses on applying deep learning to multimodal learning, specifically in the context of audio-visual data. My goal is to bridge the gap between structured knowledge and deep networks, as deep learning often overlooks explicit knowledge related to the research problem. In particular, I am interested in utilizing self-supervised learning to learn from unlabeled audio-visual data, as well as exploring multimedia recommendation systems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            üéÆüéæ In my free time, I enjoy sports, photography, and gaming. I also play padel occasionally with family and friends.
                        </p>

                        <p>
